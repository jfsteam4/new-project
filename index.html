        Lazy coconut trees, long sand beaches, crystalline blue waters, lush rainforests, sleepy volcanoes, vibrant
        green rice terraces, fiery orange sunsets, lively monkeys, and flitting colorful birds — yes, Bali is a
        quintessential tropical paradise. But the true beauty of Bali lies in the culture, the people, and the arts that
        permeate every facet of this magical island.
        Bali, predominantly Hindu, seems to live and breathe in it's strong belief system. Balinese Hinduism and village
        life creates a close-knit community of people that support each other in the various rituals, festivals and
        ceremonies. They worship the traditional Hindu gods of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, a trinity of the supreme being,
        Sanghyang Widhi. But Balinese Hindus also honor the supreme spirit manifested in all elements of nature and
        animals.
        There is an overall intention to achieve balance and harmony between humans and gods and nature. It is a sacred
        relationship that is protected and cherished throughout daily life. For instance, Balinese put out offerings —
        sometimes two or three times a day — of flowers, rice, fruit and incense. It is a way of giving back to the gods
        for what they have given you. It is also a way of keeping demons at bay. Offerings can be seen everywhere in
        Bali at their many temples and even on the sidewalk outside shops and restaurants. Be careful not to step on
        them.</p>
